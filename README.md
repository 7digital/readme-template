# Title
Brief text description of the main purpose of the repo / application in the context of our platform.

## Getting Started
Step by step guide for getting the application/project/tool set up for local development, including:
- Installation dependencies
- Any scripts or commands to run for local set up of the app
- `make` (or similar) command for running tests

## Making Changes (if applicable, i.e. if not fully obvious)
If noteworthy, please detail the general flow of making changes (a nice example is this [workflow for making changes to a Chef Repo](https://github.com/7digital/chef-repo-disco#common-windows-dev-workflow)).

## Architecture
- Include your awesome diagrams here
- Consider including relevant context of the app/tool/project

## General Operation
- Operating considerations pertaining to how the app/project/tool runs in production
- Related applications / dependencies

One example is the [General Operation section on the Solr indexers](https://github.com/7digital/solr-indexer-console#general-operation).

## Deployments
- Where is it deployed?
    - Load balancer (internal or external)
    - Cloud services
- How is it deployed?
    - CI pipeline
    - Specific deployment requirements

NB: If the repo isn't itself a deployable app (libaries, deploy tools like [Edamame](https://github.com/7digital/edamame) etc.), please still point out the CI pipeline used to run automated tests for the project.

## Monitoring
- Dashboards 
    - Datadog
    - SumoLogic
    - Grafana
- Pingdom

## Troubleshooting
- [RUNBOOK.md](https://github.com/7digital/readme-template/blob/master/RUNBOOK.md)
- FAQ, for example: [Q&A on Search API](https://github.com/7digital/search-api#troubleshooting)
- GOTCHAs and unresolved oddities

## To Do
- WIP/info in case of newer repos or ongoing projects (i.e. cloud migrations)
